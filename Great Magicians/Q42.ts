//Q.42 Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 41. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
let magicians: string[] = ['Harry Houdini','Derren Brown','Lance Burton'];
function make_great(the_Great:string[]){
    for(let i=0;i<the_Great.length;i++){
        magicians[i]='the Great '+the_Great[i]
    }
}
make_great(magicians)
function show_magicians(magicians:string[]){
    magicians.forEach(element => {
        console.log(element);
    });
};
show_magicians(magicians)
