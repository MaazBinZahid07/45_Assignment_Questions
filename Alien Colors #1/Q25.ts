//Q.25 Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

// one version of this program that passes the if test
let alien_color: string = "green";
if(alien_color==="green"){
    console.log("the player just earned 5 points")
};

// another version of this program that fails.
 alien_color = "red";
if(alien_color==="green"){
    console.log("the player just earned 5 points")
};
